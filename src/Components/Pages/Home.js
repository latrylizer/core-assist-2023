                  "When I started my career as a remote team member, all I
                  wanted was to spend more time with my daughter while earning a
                  living. I did not realize how wise my decision was until I
                  joined this team. The level of communication, commitment and
                  work quality of the people I work with are overwhelming. The
                  management team's openness to suggestions, process
                  improvements, the continuous evolution and change, also make
                  us excel and do more than what we are expected. Having to work
                  with people from all over the world is a bonus. I get to work
                  with CPAs, law students, business men, and other professionals
                  who have also joined the "remote world." This diversity pushes
                  me to also be in my "A" game and be the best that I can be.
                  Right now, I am entrusted the task of leading everyone to
                  succeed and in making sure that we all work as one to achieve
                  a common goal. I am honored, and thankful. Cheers to more
                  years with CoreAssist!"
